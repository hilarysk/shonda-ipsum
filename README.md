# shonda-ipsum

[Shondaland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShondaLand) lorem ipsum generator, created as an AlumnX project at [Write/Speak/Code 2017](https://2017.writespeakcode.com/index.html).

### How to contribute

If you're a coder, fork the project and add improvements as you see fit, then create a pull request against the original repo. [Tutorial](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)

If you're a tech civilian, you can just create an issue with any content you'd like added to the collection. [Example](https://github.com/hilarysk/shonda-ipsum/issues/4)

### wish list
- convert `phrases` in `home_controller.rb` to `yml` file (or something similar - basically separate it out from the code)
