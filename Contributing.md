## OK, I'm ready to get started. How can I help?

There are three key ways to contribute to Shonda Ipsum. 

### Improve content

- Add new phrases or sentences from Shondaland creations (if you're not a coder, feel free to open a new issue titled "Content Submission" ([see example](https://github.com/hilarysk/shonda-ipsum/issues/4)).
- Improve grammar, spelling of existing content

### Improve the front-end

- Make it prettier
- Make it easier to use
- Make it more accessible

### Improve the code

- Increase efficiency
- Reduce duplication
- Upgrade gems for security / functionality
- Etc. 

## Wish list / To-do list
- Convert `phrases` in `home_controller.rb` to `yml` file (or something similar - basically separate it out from the code)
- Improve accessibility
